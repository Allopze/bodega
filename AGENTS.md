# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

# Export Format Rule

All data exports in this app must use **XLSX** format. Never use CSV for exports. Use a library like `xlsx` or `exceljs` to generate proper `.xlsx` files with formatting support.

# Source of truth: `lib/` + `app/`, NOT frozen module scaffolding

The live business logic is in `lib/services`, `lib/auth`, `lib/validation` and the per-feature `app/(app)/<área>/actions.ts`. The old **frozen, incomplete** "monolito modular" migration (Fase 0/1) was pruned on 2026-06-14: `core/` was removed and `modules/` now keeps only the live registry/manifest surface for navigation, permission parity checks and seed/bootstrap validation.

Rules until the migration is properly resumed:

- Make every business-logic change in `lib/` + `app/`.
- `modules/registry.ts`, `modules/permissions.ts`, `modules/manifest-types.ts` and the `modules/*/manifest.ts` files are the only live module-scaffolding parts; touch those only for nav/permissions/seed/bootstrap parity.
- Do not recreate `modules/*/{services,actions,schema,validation}` or `core/*` unless the modular migration is explicitly resumed with a reconciliation plan and parity tests.
- See `modules/README.md` and the audit at `.claude/plans/shiny-scribbling-lynx.md` (finding A1) for the reconciliation plan.
